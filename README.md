## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Initialize the database
You can let the app auto-create tables, or run the SQL script:
```sh
sqlite3 inventory.db < db_init.sql
```

### 4. Run the server (Locally)
```sh
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080
```
The API will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### 5. Run with Docker (Recommended)
Build and run the backend in a container:
```sh
docker build -t inventory-backend .
docker run -p 8080:8080 inventory-backend
```

---

## Admin Portal
- Access the admin portal at: [http://localhost:8080/static/admin.html](http://localhost:8080/static/admin.html)
- Features: Login, view/add/update products, view analytics
- All actions require authentication (login with your registered user)

## Automated API Testing

A Python script (`test_api.py`) is provided to automatically test all major API endpoints and flows.

### How to Use
1. Make sure your server is running on `http://localhost:8080`.
2. Install the required library:
   ```sh
   pip install requests
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python test_api.py
   ```
4. The script will print PASS/FAIL results for registration, login, product addition, quantity update, and product listing.

## Postman Collection
- See `postman_collection.json` for ready-to-use API requests.
- Set the `base_url` and `access_token` variables as described in the documentation.

---

## Notes
- Change the JWT secret key in `app/auth.py` for production use.
- For production, use a more robust DB like PostgreSQL.
- All passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.

## AI Assistance Disclosure

> **This project was developed with the assistance of AI (OpenAI GPT-4 via Cursor).**
>
> - AI was used to help design the project structure, generate code for FastAPI endpoints, database models, and schemas, and to write and improve documentation.
> - AI also assisted in debugging, automating test scripts, and providing step-by-step guidance for API testing (Postman, Swagger, and Python scripts).
> - All code and documentation were reviewed and tested by the developer.

If you have any questions about which parts were AI-assisted, please refer to the commit history or ask the developer directly.
